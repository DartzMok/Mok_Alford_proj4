Hello there.

## Timing differences
Step 1 is much slower than step 2 as file sizes increase.
    We believe this is because reading byte by byte as in
    step 1 would incur massive I/O costs since it is an
    time-expensive process while step two does all of the
    I/O at once into the dynamically defined array and can do
    the computation into memory which is orders of magnitude
    faster that I/O.
